Lab 6 README

For this lab, I had a hard time setting up Apache to view my PHP file. It took a long time to work through the Intro to ITWS instructions on setting up the Azure VM
and connecting to GitHub. Eventually I got it and was able to view my PHP file. I used the lecture notes to help refresh my memory on PHP and understand how to do
Part 2 of the lab.
