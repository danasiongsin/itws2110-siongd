Dana Siong Sin - ITWS 2110 Lab 4

In this lab, I used ChatGPT to generate a full AI-developed app. This was a cool lab to work on and I liked seeing the outupt that the AI produced. The limitations are detailed in my write-up.

Here are the ChatGPT prompts I used to create this application:
1) Please complete this task: Create a weather app for Troy, NY that has two sections. One section displays the current weather using the OpenWeatherMap current weather API. The second section uses https://sunrise-sunset.org/api to display information about the sunrise/sunset. You can include any information you would like.

2) The headings "Current Weather" and "Sunset & Sunrise" along with the underlines are not centered in the white boxes. Please make them centered with the data

3) Do you want to make any other style changes or add extra information to the app using the APIs?

4) Yes please update the app

5) Please implement a dark mode toggle
