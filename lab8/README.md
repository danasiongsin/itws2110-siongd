Lab 8 README

This lab was great to refresh me memory on SQL. I did run into some issues, however, when setting up phpmyadmin in my VM and was unable to login. I also had trouble when I pasted me queries into phpmyadmin because the syntax is very specific. But I was able to solve these problems by looking up online for help.

The last query was the trickiest for me because I forgot some of the keywords like DISTINCT. These also required me to go back to the lecture notes to review.
