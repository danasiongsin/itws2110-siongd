Web Systems Development Lab 3 README

This lab, I used the OpenWeatherMap API to get the current weather. I encountered a few challenges at first, while trying to figure out how to use the API properly. After asking Juniper a few questions, I was able to figure out the correct API to call and was successful. I found it helpful to read through the lecture notes on AJAX and JSON while I was developing the application.

I also used the API from https://sunrise-sunset.org/ to get information on the sun and daylight hours. I decided to add a "help" icon to clarify one of the sun data (solar noon) I display on the site since I did not know this myself. Overall, I enjoyed developing this lab.

I validated my HTML and CSS files using https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_upload and https://validator.w3.org/nu/#file.

The OpenWeatherMap API key is removed from the HTML file. The key is in the submitted PDF.
